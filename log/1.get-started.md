### Source and Sink
- `main()` represents the pure dataflow, provide the **Sinks** for the ap
plication.
- the DOM, http are taken as side effects, which use the Sink as the input. They are mangaged by the *driver* plugins.

### Reactive Functions
- separate the concern
- keep the code clean
- this-less and simply input-output
- no imperative calls for setState() and foo.update()

### Explicit dataflow
- each of declaration of the stream is the **node** in the flow-graph
- the flow of the data is clear

### Components
- a function can be reused in a larger cyclejs app
- not exclusive to the DOM, can be Web Audio , Network Requests
